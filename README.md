# HYDE - Allergy-Friendly Cosmetics Finder  

HYDE is a **Chrome extension** designed to help individuals identify cosmetic products that contain allergens or specific molecules they may be sensitive to. Inspired by people around me who experience allergic reactions to certain cosmetic ingredients, this extension makes it easier to avoid harmful substances and find safer alternatives.
